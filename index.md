## CS4457 Computer Networks

### Spring 2026
### Course Overview

Computer networks are among the most vital and transformative infrastructures of our time—imagine a world without the Internet! Even after more than 50 years of remarkable success, communication networks continue to grow in scale, complexity, and functionality, facing ever-increasing demands for robustness, scalability, efficiency, flexibility, and security.
CS 4457 is an undergraduate course that explores the fundamental concepts of computer networking, including:
- Architectural principles that underpin modern networks;
- Design strategies for achieving reliability, scalability, efficiency, and security;
- Core mechanisms and protocols for addressing, routing, forwarding, and congestion control.

My goal for you in this course is not only to understand what computer networks are and how they operate today, but also to appreciate why they are designed the way they are—and how they might continue to evolve in the future.
