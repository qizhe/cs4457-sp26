### Problem Sets
- There will be six problem sets
- No grades: Problem sets are for practice and will not be graded; however, completing them is highly beneficial as similar questions may appear on exams and quizzes
- Collaboration encouraged: You are strongly encouraged to work with classmates – collaboration is one of the most effective ways to learn and discuss networking concepts
- Discussion opportunities: TAs will go over solutions during office hours and on Piazza – feel free to ask any questions about the problem sets
- Solutions: Official solutions will be released within one week after each problem set is posted – this gives you time to attempt the problems (ideally with peers) before reviewing the solutions

--- 

### In-class Surprise Quizzes
There will be several in-class surprise quizzes throughout the semester
- No announcement: Quizzes will not be announced in advance – the goal is to encourage you to review the material regularly, as a quiz may occur on any day and at any point during the lecture
- Unknown number of quizzes: There may be a quiz every lecture, or none at all – all quizzes will contribute equally to this portion of your grade
- Closed book: All quizzes are closed-book and closed-notes
- Academic integrity: Any form of cheating will result in an immediate F for the course – this applies to both the copier and the copied, so it is your responsibility to ensure others cannot view your answers

---

### Exams
There will be three in-class exams on 02/10, 03/05, and 04/28

- If you have a conflict, you must email [](email) with the subject line "Exam conflict declaration" before 01/20 – conflicts not declared by this date cannot be accommodated
- All exams are cumulative – they will cover material from lectures, quizzes, and problem sets up to one week before the exam
- All exams are open-book and open-notes
- Academic integrity: if anyone is found cheating on an exam, both the copier and the copied will receive an F for the course – it is your responsibility to ensure others cannot see your work
