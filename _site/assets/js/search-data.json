    "content": "Students with disabilities or learning needs . It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may email her at cmacmasters@virginia.edu to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the SDAC website: sdac.studenthealth.virginia.edu. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together. Religious accommodations . It is the University’s long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence . The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence.  . The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. UVA policy also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to Just Report It justreportit.virginia.edu or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights. If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (“CAPS”) and Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates (for students of all genders).  . As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator’s job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. Support for your career development . Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations. Student support team . You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help!  . Learning .  Lisa Lampe, Assistant Dean for Undergraduate Affairs . Georgina Nembhard, Director of Student Success . Courtney MacMasters, Accessibility Specialist . Free tutoring is available for most classes. Health and Wellbeing . Kelly Garrett, Assistant Dean of Students, Student Safety and Support   . Elizabeth Ramirez-Weaver, CAPS counselor . Katie Fowler, CAPS counselor . You may schedule time with the CAPS counselors through Student Health.

The Center for Connection (The Connect) is a dedicated student space within UVA Engineering that fosters academic success and personal growth. Through its programs and initiatives, The Connect helps students strengthen their engineering identity while providing resources to help them thrive during their studies and beyond. Our work centers on three key areas: student belonging and development, academic support, and community programming grounded in intentional, data-driven strategies. The Connect features an open study area, a flexible event space, and on-site staff who provide direct support and advising to students. It is part of the Office of Community, Opportunity, and Engagement. ",

    "content": "Spring 2026 . Course Overview . Computer networks are among the most vital and transformative infrastructures of our time—imagine a world without the Internet! Even after more than 50 years of remarkable success, communication networks continue to grow in scale, complexity, and functionality, facing ever-increasing demands for robustness, scalability, efficiency, flexibility, and security. CS 4457 is an undergraduate course that explores the fundamental concepts of computer networking, including: . | Architectural principles that underpin modern networks; | Design strategies for achieving reliability, scalability, efficiency, and security; | Core mechanisms and protocols for addressing, routing, forwarding, and congestion control. | . My goal for you in this course is not only to understand what computer networks are and how they operate today, but also to appreciate why they are designed the way they are—and how they might continue to evolve in the future.
